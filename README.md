# ReinforcementLearning_Cartpole

Plays the cart pole game automatically and gains the maximum score possible in the game

Defination - Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions. The agent learns to achieve a goal in an uncertain,potentially complex environment.

Description- We try to get maximum score in a game called Cartpole. In each iteration we find the outcome of the random movement and store the loss and thus finding the best outcomes to get maximum outcomes.
